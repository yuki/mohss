# My own Home Security System

This is a personal project to make a Home Security System with a Rapsberry Pi.

The first reason to do it is to learn how Rapsberry's GPIO works, the second
one is to make a personal project which mix hardware and software.

I'll try to do it as professional as I can, because the intention is to 
replicate it in my parent's home.

I'll try to make a server/client version to control all the platform with
a web app to activate/deactivate the security system and to know how it is in
every moment (real time).
